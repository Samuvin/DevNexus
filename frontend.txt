CORS ORIGIN

We cannot make api calls to different origin 
ORIGIN we send request 1111 to 2222


If we send request from domain udemy to domain udemy its ok
This cors error is browser error 
Postman dont bother cors error 

But browser consider it as trouble
We are making request from localhost to localhost
it will also cause error

Because the PORT matters


IF we are not on the same domain 
If we are not using https browsers dont set the cookies automatically 
To that we need to configure cors credentials true
